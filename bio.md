## Bio

I'm an evolutionary biologist interested in fundamental theories about adaptation and tests of such theories. I grew up in the [French Alps near Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vovray-en-Bornes), then moved to London (UCL) for my undergraduate and postgraduate education. I did my PhD studies in the [UCL Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/gee), working on the [genetics of sexually antagonistic variation](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10064363/) in *Drosophila melanogaster* under the primary supervision of **Prof. Max Reuter** (2015-18). For my postdoctoral research (2019-present), I am based in the Monash [School of Biological Sciences](https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/biological-sciences) (Melbourne), where I collaborate with evolutionary theoretician **Dr Tim Connallon** to address a variety of questions about the genetics of adaptation.
