## Bio

I am an evolutionary biologist interested in testing fundamental theories about evolutionary adaptation. I grew up in the [French Alps near Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vovray-en-Bornes). I then moved to London (UCL) for my university education, including a PhD in the [UCL Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/gee). There I worked on the [genetics of sexually antagonistic variation](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10064363/) in *Drosophila melanogaster* under the supervision of **Prof. Max Reuter** (2015-18). I then moved to the Monash [School of Biological Sciences](https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/biological-sciences) (Melbourne) for a postdoc (2019-2023). There I collaborated with theoretician **Dr Tim Connallon** to tackle a variety of long-standing questions about the evolution of sex differences and sex chromosomes. Since 2023, I am an independent research fellow at the [Institute of Science and Technology Autria](https://ista.ac.at/home) (ISTA), hosted by **Prof. Beatriz Vicoso**. My fellowship work is focussed on better understanding the role of genetic dominance in evolution.
